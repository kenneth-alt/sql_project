# Background

Driven by a quest to navigate the data engineering job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from the [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql) from Luke Barousse. It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data engineering jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data engineers?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data engineer job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for writing code, database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data engineer job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Engineer Jobs

To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Engineer' AND
    job_location = 'Canada' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Engineer' AND
        job_location = 'Canada' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Engineers

This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Engineer'
    AND job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data engineers in 2023

| Skills | Demand Count |
| ------ | ------------ |
| SQL    | 7291         |
| Python | 4611         |
| AWS    | 4330         |
| Azure  | 3745         |
| Spark  | 2609         |

### 4. Skills Based on Salary

Exploring the average salaries associated with different skills revealed which skills are the highest paying.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Engineer'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

Here's a breakdown of the results for top paying skills for Data Engineers:

- **High Demand for Big Data & ML Skills:** Top salaries are commanded by engineers skilled in big data technologies, reflecting the industry's high valuation of data processing and predictive modeling capabilities.
- **Software Development & Deployment Proficiency:** Knowledge in development and deployment tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Airflow) indicates a lucrative crossover between data analysis and engineering, with a premium on skills that facilitate automation and efficient data pipeline management.
